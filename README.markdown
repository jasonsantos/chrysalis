# Chrysalis -- safe templates in javascript

Chrysalis is a jQuery plugin for using templates in Javascript.
There has been a number of initiatives on that in the last few years,
and after analyzing some of those I felt linke entertaining the notion
of writing one of my own.

Feel free to use and contribute.
